		 represents correlations among topics using a DAG
		 structure. It does not, however, represent a nested
		 hierarchy of topics, with some topical word
		 distributions representing the vocabulary that is
		 shared among several more specific topics. This paper
		 presents Hierarchical PAM---an enhancement that
		 explicitly represents a topic hierarchy. This model can
		 be seen as combining the advantages of hLDA's topical
		 hierarchy representation with PAM's ability to mix
		 multiple leaves of the topic hierarchy. Experimental
		 results show improvements in likelihood of held-out
		 documents, as well as mutual information between
		 automatically-discovered topics and human-generated
		 categories such as journals and newsgroups.",
